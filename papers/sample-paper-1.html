                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>The healthcare industry has experienced a paradigm shift with the integration of machine learning technologies. Traditional diagnostic methods, while reliable, often require extensive human expertise and time-intensive analysis. Machine learning algorithms offer the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce analysis time, and provide consistent results across different healthcare facilities.</p>
                
                <p>This research investigates three primary areas of ML application in healthcare: diagnostic imaging analysis, predictive health analytics, and personalized treatment optimization. Each area presents unique challenges and opportunities for improving patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.</p>
